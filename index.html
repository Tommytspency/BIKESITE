      <h1> Who are we?</h1>
      <p>Cyclone cycles is a Wellington company providing bikes available to hire to the public. <br>
         Co-founder Wei Zhang is a mountain bike enthusiast who noticed that there was a lack of <br>
          accessible mountain bikes for people wanting to take part in the numerous riding trails around the Wellington region, <br>
           without having to transport the bikes from a pickup location to the destined trails. Cyclone Cycles provide mountain bikes and monster scooters on location, <br>  
           so it is easy to just get on and go! 
            We also provide electric scooters and bikes for transport around the city, <br>
             meaning that cars are a completely unnecessary part of your in-city adventure!
